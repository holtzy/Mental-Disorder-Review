‘From Data to Viz’ is a classification of chart types based on input data format. It comes in the form of a decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations to represent your dataset.This project is built on two underlying philosophies. First, that most data analysis can be summarized in about twenty different dataset formats. Second, that both data and context determine the appropriate chart. Thus, our suggested method consists in identifying and trying all feasible chart types to find out which suits your data and idea best.Dataviz is a world with endless possibilities and this project does not claim to be exhaustive. However it should provide you with a good starting point. For an interactive version and much more, visit:

An interactive version of this classification is available online. The website provides more information on each chart type and highlights a few pitfalls to avoid. For each dataset format, an example of real data analysis is offered to illustrate the different chart types, and their pros and cons.Links
